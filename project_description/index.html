                    This project is called Flexible Structure and Shadow Puppetry. This project is inspired by shadow puppetry and shadow theaters from the Chinese history. We want to exhibit the way a simple sun blocking made of a wireframe could affect the inside of a building with light and shadows. We use THREE.JS to simulate and create this wireframe and the shadows casted inside the room affected by it. Look for your favorite pattern and maybe design your perfect dim lighting device !                </p>

                    This program will help design sun blocks patterns for façades that would be totally randomized and for this reason always unique. You could use it to make light weight wireframe façades that would cut down the light depending on your needs and on the time of the day.                </p>
